            <p>This comprehensive guide provides tips and resources to help you stay safe throughout your dating journey. We encourage all users to review these guidelines before engaging with others on our platform.</p>

            <h3>Emergency Resources</h3>
            <p>In case of immediate danger, call your local emergency number:</p>
            <p>UK: 999</p>
            <p>US: 911</p>
            <p>Australia: 000</p>

                <h3><span class="safety-icon"></span>Take Time to Get to Know Each Other</h3>
                <p>Before meeting in person, spend time communicating through our platform to establish a level of comfort and trust. Use our messaging and video chat features to have meaningful conversations and look for consistency in their communication.</p>
                <p>Be wary of users who seem eager to move the conversation off the platform immediately or who push for a face-to-face meeting too quickly.</p>

                <h3><span class="safety-icon"></span>Verify Their Identity</h3>
                <p>Look for profiles with verified badges, which indicate users who have completed our verification process. Additionally, consider having a video chat before meeting in person to confirm they match their profile photos.</p>
                <p>Be cautious of profiles with only one photo, very limited information, or that seem too perfect. If something seems suspicious, trust your instincts.</p>

                <h3><span class="safety-icon"></span>Research Before Meeting</h3>
                <p>It's okay to do some basic research on a potential match before meeting them. Looking up public social media profiles can help verify that they are who they claim to be.</p>
                <p>However, respect privacy boundaries and remember that not everyone has a strong online presence.</p>

                <p>Be alert to potential warning signs such as:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Inconsistencies in their stories or profile information</li>
                    <li>Refusing video calls or always having excuses not to meet</li>
                    <li>Asking for financial assistance or gifts</li>
                    <li>Overly controlling behavior or pressuring you for personal information</li>
                    <li>Making you uncomfortable by moving too quickly in the relationship</li>
                </ul>
                <p>If you notice these or other concerning behaviors, use the "Report" function to notify our safety team.</p>

                <h3><span class="safety-icon"></span>Meet in a Public Place</h3>
                <p>Always arrange your first few meetings in busy, public locations such as cafes, restaurants, or well-populated parks. Avoid remote areas, private homes, or secluded spots for initial meetings.</p>
                <p>Choose locations where staff or other people are present throughout your meeting.</p>

                <h3><span class="safety-icon"></span>Arrange Your Own Transportation</h3>
                <p>Plan to arrive and leave independently. Avoid being picked up or dropped off at your home until you've established trust over multiple meetings. Having your own transportation gives you the freedom to leave if you feel uncomfortable.</p>
                <p>If using public transportation, make sure services are running at the time you plan to leave.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Who you're meeting (share their profile or picture if possible)</li>

                <h3><span class="safety-icon"></span>Stay Sober and Alert</h3>
                <p>Keep your wits about you by limiting alcohol consumption, especially during first meetings. Never leave your food or drinks unattended, and be suspicious if someone is encouraging you to drink more than you're comfortable with.</p>
                <p>If you feel disoriented or unusually intoxicated, seek help from venue staff immediately.</p>

                <p>If something doesn't feel right, it probably isn't. You don't need a specific reason to end a date early—your comfort and safety come first. Have an exit strategy prepared, such as a friend calling with an "emergency" or a pre-arranged time you need to leave.</p>
                <p>Never feel obligated to stay in a situation that makes you uncomfortable.</p>

                <h3><span class="safety-icon"></span>Maintain Privacy</h3>
                <p>Be cautious about sharing personal information during early meetings. Avoid discussing details like your home address, workplace location, financial information, or daily routines until trust is established.</p>
                <p>Be particularly careful about sharing information that could compromise your online accounts or identity.</p>

                <p>In cases of threatening behavior or harassment, also consider reporting to local authorities.</p>

                <p>There's no need to rush into a physical or emotional relationship. A respectful partner will understand your boundaries and be patient. Communication about comfort levels and expectations is key to building a healthy relationship.</p>
                <p>Be wary of anyone who pressures you to move faster than you're ready for.</p>
